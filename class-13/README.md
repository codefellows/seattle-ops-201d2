# Virtual networking with GNS3

Today you will setup GNS3 as part of required prework for Ops 301. GNS3 is a network virtualization application that integrates with tools like Virtualbox and VMware to allow for the hosting of a multi-host LAN on your host computer. This allows us to design ambitious sprawling networks using functional VMs without the need for cumbersome computer hardware in our physical workspace.
