# DD-WRT Router Firmware

## Overview

Installing firmware is a common operation when handling hardware devices. Often the manufacturer will require you to update firmware of a device before support can be delivered. Therefore, it is good practice to keep an eye on firmware versions of all critical network infrastructure in your organization. Some devices are able to load third party firmware to enhance its capabilities. Today you will install a custom firmware, DD-WRT, to the Linksys router from the Ops lab kit in order to enhance its capabilities.
