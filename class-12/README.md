# Networking, Ports, & Wi-fi

## Overview

The OSI Model applies to all facets of network operations, from to computer endpoints to mission-critical infrastructure. In today's lecture we review network protocols studied in Ops 102 and break apart the components of a "data packet." Critical network concepts and vocabulary will be revisited including DHCP, DNS, Router, Gateway, Firewall, and more. Commonly used port numbers will be introduced. In today's lab you will access and operate an enterprise-grade router/firewall UTM appliance and practice administrator operations including log analysis and configuration.

## Learning Objectives

### Students will be able to
